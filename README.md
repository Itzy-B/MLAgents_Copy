# Unity ML-Agents Project for Agent Control

## Project Description
- The purpose of this project is to train and evaluate autonomous agents in the Unity game engine using the ML-Agents toolkit. By applying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, we aim to teach these agents to make decisions and perform tasks effectively in a 3D environment. Specifically, the project involves setting up training environments, adjusting learning parameters, and implementing custom sensor inputs to optimize the agents' performance. The overall goal is to analyze how well different DRL algorithms and environmental setups contribute to agent learning and behavior in complex, dynamic scenarios.

## Objectives
- Set up the necessary tools: Install and configure Unity, the ML-Agents toolkit, and Git for version control to ensure a smooth development process.
- Create a project plan: Develop a detailed plan for the entire semester, outlining key milestones, tasks, and timelines to guide the project's progress.
- Familiarize the team with tools: Ensure that all team members understand how to use Unity, ML-Agents, and Git, covering both basic and advanced functionalities.
- Make small code modifications: Implement minor changes to the ML-Agents environment to gain a hands-on understanding of how agents, algorithms, and environments interact. This experimentation will lay the groundwork for more complex tasks in later phases.

## Installation and How to Run
1. **Unity**: [Download Unity](https://unity.com/)
2. **Python and Virtual Environment**: Follow the steps to set up Python and create a virtual environment for ML-Agents.
3. **Git-Hub Repository Cloning**: Clone the repository from [recommended branch](https://github.com/AIML21/main.git).
4. **Unity Setup With The Git** Open the project file in Unity which is located in Main\ml-agents\Project of the git repository.
5. **Follow the Unity Setup Process** This will conclude the setup.
